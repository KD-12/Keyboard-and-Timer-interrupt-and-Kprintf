# Keyboard-and-Timer-interrupt-and-Kprintf
This project runs on qemu. 
This project builds kernel level printf statements which outputs eact character on the terminal
when a key is pressed and an keyboard interrupt in generated. 
kprintf supports basic %c, %d, %x, %s, %p
keyboard interrupt also handels Shift key and Control key
Also in this project we maintain a clock on the bootom right corner of the terminal which displays 
the time generated by timer interrupt since boot
